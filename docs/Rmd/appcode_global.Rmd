## SNAP data QA/QC Shiny app R code

`global.R` loads **R** packages and a workspace of supporting **R** objects needed by the app.
If the app is launched from the **R** console on my own machine for testing purposes,
`global.R` will rename various file paths from the loaded **R** workspace to point to locally stored data.
It also defines some other objects, including a conditional panel used across several tab panels.

### global.R

```{r global}
```
