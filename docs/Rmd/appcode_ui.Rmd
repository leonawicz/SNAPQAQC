## SNAP data QA/QC Shiny app R code

`ui.R` first sources `about.R` and then calls `fluidPage`, inside of which is a call to `navbarPage`.
This is a bit unorthodox, and does create some very minor issues, but overall provides the flexibility I require to achieve the desired browser-side app display reactivity.
After the navbar page is set up with unique tab panel values and the `About` page and any markdown documents are included, `ui.R` then sources the sidebar and main panel **R** code,
`sidebar.R` and `main.R`.

Note that nested navbar menus are not available the current version of Shiny.

### ui.R

```{r ui}
```
