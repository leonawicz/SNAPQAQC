The `qaqc_app_metadata.R` script loads the `meta.RData` metadata workspace file used by the `cmip3_cmip5` QAQC app.
Final preparations of region and city data file path locations are completed.
This new workspace is saved over the original.

This script current handles subsetting of city files as best it can,
but ultimately time is needed to investigate why GCM and CRU extractions of the same set of cities (specific grid cells) are yielding different, overlapping sets of cities.

## R code

### Setup
ADD_TEXT_HERE: EXAMPLE
Setup consists of loading required **R** packages and additional files, preparing any command line arguments for use, and defining functions and other **R** objects.
